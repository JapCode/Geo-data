# Frontend useless commands to development mode
## Npm scripts
An npm script is just a shortcut to run a series of node commands on your project. Any npm script, meaning any node.js commands listed under a package.json file's "scripts" section, are executed through node.js when you call them.

Here you will find all the useless commands at time to work on the project:

- [Test](#test)
- [Start](#start)
- [Dev](#dev)
- [Build](#build)
- [Format](#format)
- [Lint](#lint)

## Test

```
$ npm run test
```

## Start

This command tells webpack to spin up a development server, serve the files live, and open the browser to the port you specify in the webpack.config file (or it will use the default 8080).

```
$ npm run start
```

## Dev

```
$ npm run dev
```

## Build

```
$ npm run build
```
## Format

```
$ npm run format
```

## Lint

```
$ npm run lint
```
